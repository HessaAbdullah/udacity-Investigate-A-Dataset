### Summary:
you need to choose a dataset then, You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then we use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
### Project Instructions:
1. Choose Your Data Set:
> I choosed Medical Appointment No Shows Data.
2. Analyze Your Data
> Brainstorm some questions I could answer using the data set , then I started answering those questions.
My questions:
- Who is more committed to attending the appointment, female or male ?
- Are no-show appointments associated with a certain gender?
- Do the SMS reminders decrease the number of absences?
- Are illnesses like Handicap affecting by patient's age?
3. Share Your Findings
> After analyzing the data, I create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting.
### Results:
- Female is the greater proportion in this dataset with 65% compaere to 35% M.
-  The gender doesn't affect the appointments.
-  There is a higher percentage of patients who recevied SMS and didn't show up when compared to patients who recevied SMS and did show up.
-  Which means SMS reminders help the patients to come to their appointments.
